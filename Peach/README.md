# THIS THEME WAS NOT MADE BY ME, I ONLY PUT EXISTING THEMES/ICONS/STYLES TOGETHER TO MAKE THIS THEME

The folder inside `Fluxbox_style` should go into `~/.fluxbox/styles/`

The folder inside `Icons` should go into `/usr/share/icons`

The folder inside `Theme` should go into `/usr/share/themes`

The files in `Fluxbox_styles` should go in `~/.fluxbox/`. Your existing files will be replaced, make sure you keep a backup

`compton.conf` should go in ~/.config. Make a backup for this one too.



Use lxappearance to change your theme and icons, then log-out and log-in to Fluxbox, restarting fluxbox wont change the theme for gtk-3 apps
